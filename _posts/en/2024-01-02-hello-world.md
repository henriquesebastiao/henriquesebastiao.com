I finally found a way to write a blog that I like.

No Svelte project, much less a Django server. Why use a cannon to hit a fly?

Markdown seems much cooler and more user-friendly, from now on I will dedicate myself to this blog through writings done in Markdown and pages published via GitHub Pages.

I hope you like it! Now let me get back to my insights.
